# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-on-Audio-Data
This was a group task so credits go to other group members too. (Names mentioned in Report)
We implemented Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) on audio data and evaluated its performance for duplicate detection.. Flask web app was also developed
I was not able to upload the shingle_matrix.pkl due to its huge size (3.63 GB) as well as venv (because it had too many files).
