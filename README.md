# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-on-Audio-Data
We implemented Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) on audio data and evaluated its performance for duplicate detection.. Flask web app was also developed
I was not able to upload the shingle_matrix.pkl due to its huge size (3.63 GB) as well as venv (because it had too many files).
More details in the report..
